## About AS3
ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. (later acquired by Adobe Systems). It is a derivation of HyperTalk, the scripting language for HyperCard.
ActionScript 3.0 is also used with Adobe AIR system for the development of desktop and mobile applications.
ActionScript looks a lot like JavaScript, which Macromedia (the folks who wrote Flash) did on purpose. A specification called ECMA-262 was written to provide an international standard for the JavaScript language.

## Project Details
This project is made on request of Yan Ish. It is a simple clicker game that changes background card when user clicks. On click, score increments. There is a timer that limits the gameplay. The goal is to get as many clicks in the limited time you have. A fun game for when you're bored.

## Difficulties 
I actually don't know AS3 and so, I'm building this project as I learn. If anyone want to help out, you can reach me via email nick.kartha@gmail.com or through Whatsapp/Telegram at +91-7356655935. Thanks!
